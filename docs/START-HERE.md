## ⚠️ Week 1 Mistakes (Avoid These)

❌ **Reading everything before starting** → Pick style, start building  
❌ **Accepting AI's first output** → Iterate 2-3x minimum  
❌ **Skipping screenshots** → Screenshot after every change  
❌ **Vague prompts** ("make it better") → Use metrics (4rem, #3498DB, 3rem padding)

---

## ✅ You're On Track If

**After Sprint 1:**
- Layout matches reference structure
- Typography isn't default fonts
- Colors from style palette (not random)
- Iterated 2-3 times (not first output)

**After Sprint 2:**
- Navigation works, matches style
- Mobile doesn't look broken
- Saved 30+ screenshots

**After Sprint 3:**
- All pages done (not just homepage)
- Lighthouse 90+ (not 70s)
- Works on phone (actually tested)
- Looks professional

## ❓ Quick FAQs

**Do I really write zero code?**  
Yes. AI writes it all. You guide with screenshots and descriptions.

**What if I'm not a designer?**  
That's the point. You'll develop design judgment through iteration.

**How long will this take?**  
~10 hours with AI. Without AI, this would be 40+ hours of manual coding.

**What if I get stuck?**  
Check [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](TROUBLESHOOTING.md) or ask instructor.
